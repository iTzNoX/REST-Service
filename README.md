# REST-Service

WARNING
THE CODE IS WRITTEN IN ENGLISH BUT THE PROGRAMM WILL RUN IN GERMAN

The Software provides a simple REST Service in combination with a ToDo List.
Once you run the programm you can accses it over localhost:5000/ which will redirect you to the startscreen where you can either register or login

After logging into the programm with your name and the 4 digits long login-ID youre given you will be sent to the overview page which looks different depending on your status.

If youre an Admin (own the ToDo List) you can:
add, delete or edit tasks
add, delete or show friends
view your tasks

If youre a friend (added by the admin) you can:
add, delete or edit tasks
view the tasks

If youre a normal user you can:
view the tasks

This could be helpfull in case you and your friendgroup are trying to plan new events to do together
but one of your has a lot of appointments. Using a shared ToDo List would make it easier to manage your plans.
